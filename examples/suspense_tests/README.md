# Leptos Starter Template

This is a template for use with the [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos) web framework and the [cargo-leptos](https://github.com/akesson/cargo-leptos) tool.

## Creating your template repo

If you don't have `cargo-leptos` installed you can install it with

`cargo install cargo-leptos`

Then run

`cargo leptos new --git leptos-rs/start`

to generate a new project template.

`cd {projectname}`

to go to your newly created project.

Of course you should explore around the project structure, but the best place to start with your application code is in `src/app.rs`.

## Running your project

`cargo leptos watch`

## Installing Additional Tools

By default, `cargo-leptos` uses `nightly` Rust, `cargo-generate`, and `sass`. If you run into any trouble, you may need to install one or more of these tools.

1. `rustup toolchain install nightly --allow-downgrade` - make sure you have Rust nightly
2. `rustup default nightly` - setup nightly as default, or you can use rust-toolchain file later on
3. `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` - add the ability to compile Rust to WebAssembly
4. `cargo install cargo-generate` - install `cargo-generate` binary (should be installed automatically in future)
5. `npm install -g sass` - install `dart-sass` (should be optional in future)

## Executing a Server on a Remote Machine Without the Toolchain
After running a `cargo leptos build --release` the minimum files needed are:

1. The server binary located in `target/server/release`
2. The `site` directory and all files within located in `target/site`

Copy these files to your remote server. The directory structure should be:
```text
suspense_tests
site/
```
Set the following enviornment variables (updating for your project as needed):
```text
LEPTOS_OUTPUT_NAME="suspense_tests"
LEPTOS_SITE_ROOT="site"
LEPTOS_SITE_PKG_DIR="pkg"
LEPTOS_SITE_ADDR="127.0.0.1:3000"
LEPTOS_RELOAD_PORT="3001"
```
Finally, run the server binary.

## Testing

This example includes quality checks and end-to-end testing.

To get started run this once.

```bash
cargo make ci
```

To only run the UI tests...

```bash
cargo make start-webdriver
cargo leptos watch # or cargo run...
cargo make test-ui
```

_See the [E2E README](./e2e/README.md) for more information about the testing strategy._
